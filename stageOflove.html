            "When you fall in love, your body produces a cocktail of chemicals, including dopamine (for wanting more),
             noradrenaline (for excitement, focus, and attention), testosterone 
             (for sexual interest and drive), and a drop in serotonin (which can cause that low-key obsessive feeling)</p></div>

    <div id="description2"><p>Once you have an engagement ring, pick a date for the surprise proposal to take place. 
        The date doesn’t need to fall on an anniversary or a special date. Pick a date that gives you enough leeway to prepare and get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Many guys choose to propose whilst on holiday together.
         Or, you can choose to ask her to marry you locally.</p></div>

            <p>Kissing is an act of love. It is an intimate act that stimulates various physiological and psychological responses in our bodies. When two people kiss, there is a chain reaction of biological processes that is responsible for releasing a host of hormones and chemicals that can cause changes in everything from our heart rate to our mood.

                In love, the common feeling that brings two hearts in the marital union is “I am for you and you are for me”. This mutual love results in a strong relationship. People marrying through love feel they have landed on happy and successful life. Love marriage is often not an easy journey.
                 In many cases, the couple faces trials and tribulations on the way to its union. Hence they are motivated to demonstrate a strong commitment that will put them in a lifelong bond.
